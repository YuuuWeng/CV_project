# CV_project Stereo disparity


# Project Overview
This report compared the fundamental block- matching approach to the kernel-based accelerated method with three distinct matching cost functions SAD, SSD and NCC. And in order to compute a better disparity map, grid search is utilized for finding the superior searching window size and matching window size (kernel size). Afterward, the pre-processing and post-smoothing methods are implemented for achieving better performance of the computed disparity map.


# Feedback
Report Structure/Writing: 
Your report is clear and well-structured. 
However, you should summarise the dataset with meaningful statistics (e.g., dataset size, train/test/dev size, balanced/imbalanced, feature stats etc.)


Method and Justification:
Good attempt to clarify what you are doing and how.
You were expected to state a clear and testable research question. The stated research question is too general. We were expecting you to state a clear and testable research question.
Would be greater to see the research scope extended further, with in-class technique as baselines, and attempt more advanced techniques from research papers.


Experimentation and Evaluation:
Based on analysing the error from your model(s) you were expected to develop a hypothetical solution or explanation. Your analysis lacks this coherence.
This would have been a good opportunity to dig deeper, perhaps by examining more (or more insightful) examples.
In understand due to page limit, these are all you can pack into this report, but some images can be resized to accommodate more contents.
